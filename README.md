# SMS Spam Classification using NLP

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary steps include data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. The project implements three different feature extraction methods: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, and Word2Vec, and compares their effectiveness in classifying SMS messages.
